                    - Specific recommendations tied to project execution and planning

            3. Correlation & Cross-Domain Analysis

                Analyze interdependencies across {transaction_risks}, {resources_risks}, and {project_risks}. Your goal is to identify how issues in one domain amplify or trigger risks in another, and how they form cascading or cyclical risk patterns.

                What to do:
                - Detect root-cause triggers (e.g., failed transactions, resource constraints, security breaches).
                - Trace downstream impacts on project delivery, quality, velocity, or cost.
                - Identify cross-domain feedback loops, where issues in one area worsen conditions in another and circle back.
                - Highlight hidden dependencies or indirect links (e.g., expired software license â†’ stalled development â†’ missed release).
                - Avoid using predefined chainsâ€”build correlations dynamically using observed data relationships such as order of events, recurrence, and magnitude.
                - For each correlation, infer the specific reasoning behind it. (Example:
                    "Transaction anomaly caused a delayed vendor payment, leading to cloud downtime, which delayed integration testing.")
                - Provide 9-10 examples of inferred correlations with clear descriptions, statistics, and numeric values to prove your point.
                

                - Construct a Dynamic Cause-Effect Matrix
                - For every inferred correlation, populate a matrix with:
                    - Source domain
                    - Cause description (your inference)
                    - Target domain
                    - Effect description
                    - Confidence score (based on frequency, impact, or correlation strength)
                 
                    Example format:

                    | Source Domain     | Cause Description         | Effect Domain     | Effect Description           | Confidence Level      |
                    |-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
                    | You infer this dynamically from data logs and not from static templates or hardcoded rules.                              |

                Avoid Hardcoded Chains:
                You must not depend on static examples like "policy violation â†’ software issue â†’ delivery delay." Instead, analyze logs, audit trails, and historical events to build these relationships yourself, based on frequency, ordering, and impact.

            4. Overall Risk Scoring

                Objective:
                You must assess the overall risk level by combining individual domain scores using a weighted model and produce a final risk score with a meaningful classification.

                What You Should Do:

                - Step 1: Calculate Domain-Specific Scores
                - Evaluate each domain (Transaction, Resource, Project) independently using normalized indicators such as frequency, severity, and persistence of risk events.
                - Convert raw metrics into a 0â€“100 score for each domain.

                - Step 2: Apply Domain Weights
                - Use predefined or dynamically determined weights (e.g., Transaction: 30%, Resource: 35%, Project: 35%) to reflect the importance of each domain in the context of the current project.

                - Step 3: Generate Weighted Risk Table

                    | Domain         | Raw Score (0â€“100)     | Weight (%)     | Weighted Score      |
                    |----------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------|
                    | Transaction    | XX                    | 30%            | XX Ã— 0.30           |
                    | Resource       | XX                    | 35%            | XX Ã— 0.35           |
                    | Project        | XX                    | 35%            | XX Ã— 0.35           |
                    | Total          |                       |                | Final Aggregated    |

                - Step 4: Classify Final Risk Scor
                - Based on the final score (0â€“100), assign a qualitative risk band:
                    - ðŸŸ¢ Low (0â€“25)
                    - ðŸŸ¡ Medium (26â€“50)
                    - ðŸ”´ High (51â€“75)
                    - ðŸš¨ Critical (76â€“100)


            5. Observations & Alerts

                Objective:
                You must proactively detect and surface hidden or emerging risks before they escalate.

                What You Should Do:

                - Identify Emerging Risks:
                - Use trend analysis and anomaly detection to identify slowly growing risks.
                - Look for a gradual rise in event frequency, severity, or a widening deviation from baselines.

                - Spot Blind Spots:
                - Identify areas in the system where no data is being collected or monitored.
                - For example, check if thereâ€™s no visibility into:
                    - Facility uptime
                    - Team availability or skill readiness
                    - Third-party service performance

                - Alert on External Dependency Risks:
                - Monitor for external signals such as:
                    - Vendor changes or instability
                    - Regulatory updates
                    - Market shifts (e.g., supply chain delays)
                - Match these signals with internal dependencies and raise alerts if overlaps exist.

            Formatting Guidelines:
            - Use clear section headings in plain text (no markdown).
            - Use bullet points and numbered lists to improve readability.
            - Ensure consistent indentation and spacing for legibility.
            - Align all risk levels with appropriate symbols and numeric scores.
            - Do not use HTML, JSON, or markup in the output. Only human-readable .txt format.


            The txt file should NOT include the markdown symbols in the output (like **, #, ---). The report should be structured and easy to read, with clear headings and subheadings for each section. Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate to enhance readability.
