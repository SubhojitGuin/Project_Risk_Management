This task involves identifying direct and indirect risk interactions across domains, evaluating cumulative risk exposure, and assessing potential cascading failures.

            The agent should leverage rule-based intelligence to:

            - Detect cross-domain interdependencies (e.g., how resource constraints amplify project timeline delays or transaction anomalies affect stakeholder trust).
            - Quantify individual and aggregated severity using a weighted scoring model.
            - Classify each risk into appropriate severity tiers: Low, Moderate, High, Critical.
            - Correlate risk types and identify hidden, compound threats that aren't apparent when risks are analyzed in isolation.

            Finally, the agent must generate strategic and prioritized recommendations tailored to different stakeholder roles (project manager, security officer, resource coordinator, etc.), helping them to act decisively on mitigation or contingency plans.

            Formatting Guidelines:
            - Use clear section headings in plain text (no markdown).
            - Use bullet points and numbered lists to improve readability.
            - Ensure consistent indentation and spacing for legibility.
            - Align all risk levels with appropriate symbols and numeric scores.
            - Do not use HTML, JSON, or markup in the output. Only human-readable .txt format.


            The txt file should NOT include the markdown symbols in the output (like **, #, ---). The report should be structured and easy to read, with clear headings and subheadings for each section. Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate to enhance readability.
