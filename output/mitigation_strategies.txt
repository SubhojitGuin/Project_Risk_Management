  2. Protocol deviations causing delays in transaction approvals.  
  3. Unauthorized access resulting in irregular transaction patterns.  
- Resource Risks:  
  1. Human resource turnover leading to shortages of skilled personnel.  
  2. Hardware overutilization resulting in overheating and performance issues.  
  3. Software license expirations creating compliance risks.  
- Project Risks:  
  1. Delays in project timelines due to milestone completion issues.  
  2. Budget overruns exceeding estimated final spend.  
  3. Governance issues causing stakeholder engagement challenges.  

3. Mitigation Strategies  
- Transaction Risks:  
  1. Implement automated checks for duplicate entries.  
     - Feasibility: High, requires software updates and testing.  
     - Impact: Reduces errors in transactions, enhances operational efficiency.  
  2. Enhance transaction logging mechanisms.  
     - Feasibility: Medium, may require additional resources for implementation.  
     - Impact: Improved traceability and accountability for transactions.  

- Resource Risks:  
  1. Hire contractors to fill human resource gaps.  
     - Feasibility: High, requires budget allocation for temporary hires.  
     - Impact: Immediate relief for workload and SLA compliance.  
  2. Procure new servers to replace overheating units.  
     - Feasibility: Medium, requires capital expenditure approval.  
     - Impact: Improved system reliability and performance.  
  3. Conduct software audits to manage license compliance.  
     - Feasibility: High, can be executed internally with existing staff.  
     - Impact: Reduces compliance risks and potential fines.  

- Project Risks:  
  1. Increase focus on integration testing.  
     - Feasibility: Medium, may require reallocating current resources.  
     - Impact: Enhances product quality and reduces bug density.  
  2. Allocate additional resources to expedite project processes.  
     - Feasibility: Medium, may require budget adjustments.  
     - Impact: Helps in meeting project timelines and reducing backlog.  

4. Feasibility Assessment  
- Each mitigation strategy has been assessed for feasibility based on resource requirements, potential challenges, and alignment with project goals. Strategies with high feasibility and significant impact should be prioritized for immediate implementation.  

5. Impact Analysis  
- Each strategy's potential impact has been evaluated considering benefits and drawbacks:  
  - Automated checks and enhanced logging will significantly improve transaction integrity but may require upfront investment in software development.  
  - Hiring contractors will alleviate immediate resource shortages but could increase project costs.  
  - Integration testing and resource allocation will improve project delivery but may disrupt current workflows.  

6. Recommendations  
- Short-Term Actions (1-7 Days):  
  - Implement automated checks for duplicate transactions.  
  - Hire contractors to address immediate human resource shortages.  

- Mid-Term Actions (1-4 Weeks):  
  - Enhance transaction logging mechanisms.  
  - Procure new servers to replace overheating units.  
  - Conduct software audits for compliance.  

- Long-Term Strategies (4+ Weeks):  
  - Increase focus on integration testing and allocate additional resources to expedite project processes.  

- Assign Risk Owners:  
  - Transaction Risks: IT Department  
  - Resource Risks: HR and Operations  
  - Project Risks: Project Management Office  

7. Conclusion  
- The analysis identifies critical risks within the project and outlines actionable strategies for mitigation. By prioritizing high-impact strategies and ensuring proper resource allocation, the project can effectively address its current challenges and enhance its overall success. Immediate action is required to mitigate the most severe risks, while strategic planning will ensure sustainable improvements in the long term.
