Risk Mitigation Strategies Analysis Report  
Project Name and Date of Analysis: Prevention of Data Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning, April 2025  
Overall Project Risk Classification: High  

1. Executive Summary  
- Summary of key risk contributors:  
  - Transaction anomalies including duplicate transactions and policy violations.  
  - Resource shortages and overutilization, particularly in human and hardware resources.  
  - Project-level risks such as delivery delays and budget overruns.  
- Cross-domain interdependencies:  
  - SLA violations (Transaction) causing human burnout (Resource) leading to missed milestones (Project).  
- Domain-Level Heatmap:  
  - Transaction Risk: High  
  - Resource Risk: High  
  - Project Risk: High  

2. Risk Identification  
a) Transaction Risk  
- Duplicate Transactions: Occurrences of the same transaction being recorded multiple times, leading to financial discrepancies.  
- SLA Violations: Instances where service level agreements are not met, affecting operational efficiency.  
- Protocol Deviations: Non-adherence to established protocols, risking data integrity.  
- Unauthorized Access: Instances of access without proper authorization, posing security threats.  

b) Resource Risk  
- Human Resource Shortages: Insufficient personnel to meet project demands, leading to overwork and burnout.  
- Hardware Overutilization: Excessive use of hardware resources, resulting in potential failure or slowdown.  
- Cloud Resource Strain: High utilization rates of cloud services leading to performance issues and potential service interruptions.  

c) Project Risk  
- Delivery Delays: Missed deadlines impacting project timelines and stakeholder satisfaction.  
- Budget Overruns: Exceeding the allocated budget, risking project viability.  
- Scope Creep: Uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in project scope, affecting resource allocation.  

3. Mitigation Strategies  
a) Transaction Risk Mitigation Strategies  
- Implement Automated Duplicate Detection Systems:  
  - Description: Use software to identify and prevent duplicate transactions in real-time.  
  - Feasibility: Requires investment in technology and training staff; moderately feasible.  
  - Impact Analysis: Reduces errors and enhances trust in transaction data; potential initial resistance from staff.  

- Enhance Validation Rules During Transaction Entry:  
  - Description: Strengthen the criteria for accepting transactions to ensure compliance.  
  - Feasibility: Low-cost adjustments to existing systems; highly feasible.  
  - Impact Analysis: Decreases the likelihood of errors; may slow down transaction processing temporarily.  

b) Resource Risk Mitigation Strategies  
- Hire Contractors to Fill Human Resource Gaps:  
  - Description: Bring in temporary staff to cover shortages and reduce burnout.  
  - Feasibility: Moderate cost and time to onboard; feasible if budget allows.  
  - Impact Analysis: Alleviates pressure on current staff, improving morale; risk of inconsistent quality from contractors.  

- Procure Additional Servers:  
  - Description: Increase hardware capacity to accommodate higher loads.  
  - Feasibility: Requires capital expenditure; feasible with budget adjustments.  
  - Impact Analysis: Reduces strain on existing systems, improving performance; initial setup time required.  

c) Project Risk Mitigation Strategies  
- Enhance Integration Testing with Legacy Systems:  
  - Description: Increase focus on testing interactions with older systems to avoid delays.  
  - Feasibility: Requires time and resources; feasible with proper planning.  
  - Impact Analysis: Identifies issues early, preventing delays; may require additional resources.  

- Allocate Additional Resources to Expedite Integration:  
  - Description: Assign more personnel to critical integration tasks.  
  - Feasibility: Dependent on resource availability; feasible if managed effectively.  
  - Impact Analysis: Accelerates project timelines; risk of overloading team members if not managed.  

4. Feasibility Assessment  
- Each mitigation strategy has been assessed based on resource requirements, time constraints, and potential challenges.  
- Strategies with moderate to high feasibility should be prioritized for immediate implementation.  

5. Impact Analysis  
- Evaluated the potential effects of each strategy on project success, considering both benefits and drawbacks.  
- Recommended strategies that yield the highest return on investment and risk reduction.  

6. Recommendations  
- Short-Term Actions (1–7 Days):  
  - Implement automated duplicate detection systems and enhance validation rules.  
  - Hire contractors to address human resource shortages.  

- Mid-Term Actions (1–4 Weeks):  
  - Procure additional servers and enhance integration testing.  
  - Allocate additional resources for expedited project delivery.  

- Long-Term Strategies (4+ Weeks):  
  - Develop policies for ongoing monitoring of transaction anomalies and resource utilization.  
  - Establish a formal governance framework to manage project scope and stakeholder engagement.  

- Assign Risk Owners:  
  - Designate team leads for each risk area to ensure accountability and proactive management.  

7. Conclusion  
- The analysis outlines a comprehensive approach to mitigating identified risks in the project.  
- Immediate actions are essential to address high-severity risks, while mid- and long-term strategies will ensure sustained project success.  
- Regular monitoring and adjustment of strategies will be critical in navigating the complexities of the project.  

This report serves as a roadmap for addressing the risks associated with the Prevention of Data Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning project, ensuring that the project is well-prepared to handle potential challenges effectively.
