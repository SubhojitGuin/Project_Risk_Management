       - Tune autovacuum settings.  

2. **Identified Issues and Potential Impacts**  
   - High resource utilization across human, hardware, and cloud resources leading to potential burnout and SLA breaches.  
   - Shortages in critical human resources can delay project milestones and affect deliverables.  
   - Compliance risks due to software licenses nearing expiration and cloud compliance issues could lead to legal penalties.  
   - Over-dependence on specific hardware resources (e.g., GPUs) creates a single point of failure.  

3. **Rule-based Justification**  
   - Human Resources:  
     - Shortage of 15 resources exceeds the 20% threshold.  
     - Resignation rate of 5% meets the threshold.  
     - Utilization exceeds the maximum threshold of 90%.  
   - Hardware Resources:  
     - Utilization above 90% and overheating issues present critical risks.  
     - End-of-life servers without budget for replacement.  
   - Cloud Resources:  
     - AWS compute utilization exceeds 95% and budget constraints exceed 25%.  
   - Software Resources:  
     - License utilization exceeds 95%, with expiring licenses approaching the threshold.  
   - Database Resources:  
     - Utilization exceeds 95% with high latency issues affecting performance.  

4. **Mitigation Recommendations**  
   - **Immediate Actions**:  
     - Hire contractors for immediate skill shortages in human resources.  
     - Procure additional servers and upgrade critical hardware.  
     - Renew software licenses before expiration.  
   - **Strategic Actions**:  
     - Invest in training programs to fill skill gaps over time.  
     - Establish a proactive compliance monitoring system for licenses and regulations.  
     - Diversify cloud resource providers to mitigate vendor dependency.
