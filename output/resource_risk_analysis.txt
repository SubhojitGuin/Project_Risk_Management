Identified Issues and Potential Impacts:  
- Human Resources:  
   - Shortage of skilled personnel may lead to project delays and increased workload on existing staff.  
   - High turnover risk can disrupt team dynamics and project continuity.  
- Hardware Resources:  
   - High server utilization and overheating can cause system failures, impacting service availability.  
   - Critical GPU resources nearing saturation may delay AI processing tasks.  
- Cloud Resources:  
   - Exceeding budget thresholds for AWS compute can lead to financial strain and necessitate immediate cost-cutting measures.  
   - Storage shortages can affect data access and processing efficiency.  
- Software Resources:  
   - Expiring licenses may lead to compliance issues and potential service disruptions if not addressed promptly.  
- Database Resources:  
   - High contention and latency issues can degrade application performance and user experience.  

Rule-based Justification:  
- Human Resources:  
   - Shortage of 15 (25% of required) exceeds the 20% threshold.  
   - Resignation rate at 5% meets the threshold but turnover risk at 14.5% exceeds the 10% threshold.  
   - Utilization rate of 92% exceeds the 90% maximum.  
   - Skill gaps exceed the threshold of 3.  

- Hardware Resources:  
   - Server utilization at 91.6% exceeds the 90% threshold.  
   - Overloaded cores at 12% exceed the 10% threshold.  
   - Critical issues such as overheating have been identified.  

- Cloud Resources:  
   - AWS compute utilization at 97.5% exceeds the 95% threshold.  
   - Budget exceeds threshold by 20%.  

- Software Resources:  
   - License utilization at 96.67% exceeds the 95% threshold.  
   - 18 licenses expiring soon trigger compliance risks.  

- Database Resources:  
   - Utilization at 98% exceeds the 95% threshold.  
   - Average query latency of 180 ms exceeds the 150 ms threshold.  

Mitigation Recommendations:  
- Immediate Actions:  
   - Hire contractors to fill skill gaps in Kubernetes and GraphQL immediately.  
   - Procure new servers and upgrade CPUs without delay to prevent overheating and failure.  
   - Convert AWS compute instances to reserved instances to manage costs effectively.  

- Strategic Actions:  
   - Develop a long-term talent acquisition strategy in partnership with local universities to address ongoing skill shortages.  
   - Implement regular training programs to upskill existing employees and reduce turnover risk.  
   - Establish a robust monitoring system for hardware and cloud resources to anticipate and mitigate issues before they impact operations.  
   - Create a comprehensive compliance strategy to address upcoming regulatory changes and ensure adherence to data management laws.
