Identified Issues and Potential Impacts:  
- High turnover risk in human resources may lead to project delays and increased costs due to the need for hiring and training.  
- Over-utilization of CPU and GPU resources can lead to performance bottlenecks, impacting SLA compliance and project deliverables.  
- AWS compute and storage exceeding budget thresholds may result in financial strain and require immediate attention or adjustments.  
- Compliance risks related to software licenses and database operations could lead to legal implications and project delays.  

Rule-based Justification:  
- Human Resources:  
   - Resignation rate at 5.0% meets the threshold but indicates potential churn risk.  
   - Utilization rate at 92% exceeds the maximum threshold of 90%, indicating overuse.  
   - Turnover risk at 14.5% exceeds the threshold of 10%, indicating a significant risk factor.   

- Hardware Resources:  
   - CPU and GPU utilization rates exceed the defined thresholds, indicating critical resource pressure.  
   - Issues with overheating servers and end-of-life hardware pose compliance and operational risks.  

- Cloud Resources:  
   - AWS compute and storage utilization rates exceed the thresholds, indicating risks of overuse and budget exceedance.  
   - Compliance risks associated with cloud resources could lead to significant SLA impacts.  

- Software Resources:  
   - License utilization nearing 95% indicates a risk of non-compliance and operational delays.  

- Database Resources:  
   - High utilization rates and latency issues indicate potential bottlenecks, affecting performance and SLA compliance.  

Mitigation Recommendations:  
Immediate:  
- Hire contractors to fill skill gaps in human resources.  
- Procure new servers to replace aging infrastructure and mitigate overheating issues.  
- Convert AWS compute to reserved instances to manage costs effectively.  
- Renew expiring software licenses to maintain compliance.  

Strategic:  
- Initiate skill development programs for existing staff to reduce turnover risk.  
- Implement proactive monitoring and load-balancing strategies for CPU and GPU resources.  
- Explore cloud optimization strategies to manage budget and resource allocation effectively.  
- Develop a compliance framework to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and avoid penalties.
