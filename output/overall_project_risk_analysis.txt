3. Correlation & Cross-Domain Analysis
   - Inferred correlations:
     1. High transaction anomalies (duplicate transactions) caused delays in vendor payments, leading to cash flow issues.
     2. Resource shortages in human capital resulted in increased workload, causing SLA violations in transaction processing.
     3. Overutilization of cloud resources led to increased costs, which affected budget allocations for project milestones.
     4. Delayed approvals in transactions caused a backlog in project deliverables, impacting overall project timelines.
     5. High turnover rates in human resources led to a lack of expertise, resulting in increased errors in transaction processing.
     6. Compliance violations in vendor management resulted in delays in project execution due to re-evaluation processes.
     7. Unusual fund flows indicated potential fraud, which led to increased scrutiny and delays in project funding.
     8. High cloud spend due to resource overutilization impacted budget availability for critical project phases.
     9. Incomplete documentation for transactions led to audit issues, which delayed project approvals and escalated costs.
