     - Mitigation Steps: Enforce stricter PO-invoice match validation processes to reduce mismatches.

2. Compliance
   - Policy Violations:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Unapproved vendor invoicing and unjustified hardware purchases.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct regular compliance training for staff and implement a strict approval process for all vendor transactions.

   - Manual Overrides:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: High manual intervention in transaction approvals.
     - Mitigation Steps: Reduce manual overrides by automating the approval workflow and setting predefined thresholds for approvals.

   - Approval Process Bypasses:
     - Severity: High

     - Mitigation Steps: Implement a robust tracking system for invoice approvals and establish accountability measures for bypasses.

3. Fraud Risk
   - Multiple Payments to Same Vendor/Account:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Insufficient monitoring of payment patterns.
     - Mitigation Steps: Flag and freeze suspicious accounts and conduct regular reviews of payment histories.

   - Unusual Fund Flows:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Unexplained fund flows totaling $47,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Investigate unusual transactions and enhance monitoring of fund flows to identify and address anomalies promptly.

   - Unjustified Transactions:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Lack of clarity in transaction justifications.

4. Vendor Risk
   - Vendor Performance Issues:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Late deliverables and invoice discrepancies from high-risk vendors.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct vendor risk re-evaluation and establish performance benchmarks for vendor deliveries.

   - Compliance Flags:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Existing compliance issues with vendors.
     - Mitigation Steps: Monitor vendor compliance closely and address issues proactively to avoid project delays.

   - High Dependency Vendors:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Reliance on a limited number of vendors.
     - Mitigation Steps: Diversify the vendor base to reduce dependency and mitigate risks associated with vendor performance.

5. Financial Exposure
   - Budget Variance:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Estimated final spend exceeding the total budget by $150,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Regularly review budget allocations and adjust spending forecasts to align with actual expenditures.

   - Overdue Payments:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: 3 overdue payables totaling $120,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Implement a proactive accounts payable process to ensure timely payments and reduce overdue amounts.

   - Credit Exposure:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: 73.3% utilization of the credit limit.

6. Operational Risk
   - Timeline Impact:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Schedule variance of 8 days.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct regular project timeline reviews and adjust resources to stay on track with deadlines.

   - Resource Risk:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Resource turnover rate of 12.5%.
     - Mitigation Steps: Enhance employee retention strategies and conduct regular assessments of resource availability.

   - High Cloud Spend:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Monthly cloud spend exceeding budget thresholds.
     - Mitigation Steps: Review cloud service contracts and explore cost-effective alternatives to reduce spending.

7. Audit & Traceability
   - Audit Trail Completeness:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Incomplete documentation during transactions.
     - Mitigation Steps: Ensure comprehensive record-keeping for all transactions and conduct regular audits to verify completeness.
