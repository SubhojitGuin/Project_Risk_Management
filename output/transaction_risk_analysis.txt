1. Integrity & Anomalies
   - Duplicate Transactions:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Lack of stringent checks in the transaction processing system.
     - Mitigation Steps: Implement automated duplicate detection systems and enhance validation rules during transaction entry.
   
   - Outlier Detection:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Anomalies detected in transaction patterns.
     - Mitigation Steps: Regularly monitor transaction data for outliers and establish thresholds for flagging unusual transactions.
   
   - Invoice Mismatches:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Invoice and purchase order discrepancies with a mismatch ratio of 0.18.
     - Mitigation Steps: Enforce stricter purchase order-invoice matching validation protocols.

2. Compliance
   - Policy Violations:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Unapproved vendor invoicing and unjustified hardware purchases.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct compliance training and establish a review process for vendor invoices.
   
   - Manual Overrides:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Manual overrides occurred 4 times indicating potential weaknesses in the approval process.
     - Mitigation Steps: Limit manual overrides to exceptional cases and implement a logging system for all overrides.
   
   - Approval Process Bypasses:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Invoice approval bypasses detected (3 instances).
     - Mitigation Steps: Strengthen approval workflows and ensure all transactions go through proper channels.

3. Fraud Risk
   - Multiple Payments to Same Vendor/Account:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Evidence of multi-payments to the same account.
     - Mitigation Steps: Flag and freeze suspicious accounts, and conduct a thorough review of payment histories.
   
   - Unusual Fund Flows:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Unexplained fund flows totaling $47,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Investigate the source of these fund flows and implement tighter controls on fund transfers.
   
   - Unjustified Transactions:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Transactions without proper justification.
     - Mitigation Steps: Establish clear criteria for transaction justification and conduct regular audits.

4. Vendor Risk
   - Vendor Performance Issues:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: 3 high-risk vendors identified with compliance issues such as late deliverables and invoice discrepancies.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct vendor risk re-evaluation and enforce performance improvement plans.
   
   - Compliance Flags:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Multiple compliance issues reported with vendors.
     - Mitigation Steps: Increase vendor compliance monitoring and require corrective action plans for flagged vendors.
   
   - High Dependency Vendors:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Dependency on a limited number of vendors for critical services.
     - Mitigation Steps: Diversify vendor base to mitigate risks associated with vendor dependency.

5. Financial Exposure
   - Budget Variance:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Estimated final spend exceeds budget by $150,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Tighten budget controls and conduct regular financial reviews.
   
   - Overdue Payments:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: 3 overdue payables totaling $120,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Implement payment tracking systems and establish clear payment terms with vendors.
   
   - Credit Exposure:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Credit limit utilization at 73.3%.
     - Mitigation Steps: Monitor credit utilization closely and consider negotiating higher credit limits with financial institutions.
   
   - Spend over Authorization:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Current spend exceeds budgeted amounts.
     - Mitigation Steps: Enforce stricter spending authorization processes.

6. Operational Risk
   - Timeline Impact:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Schedule variance of 8 days.
     - Mitigation Steps: Identify root causes of delays and implement corrective measures to keep the project on track.
   
   - Resource Risk:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Resource turnover rate at 12.5%.
     - Mitigation Steps: Enhance retention strategies and provide training for new hires.
   
   - High Cloud Spend:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Monthly cloud spend exceeds budget threshold ($16,000).
     - Mitigation Steps: Review cloud usage and optimize resource allocation to reduce costs.

7. Audit & Traceability
   - Audit Trail Completeness:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Audit issues count stands at 3 from the last audit.
     - Mitigation Steps: Improve documentation processes and ensure all transactions are traceable.
   
   - Last Audit Findings:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Issues related to unjustified hardware purchases and unapproved vendor invoicing.
     - Mitigation Steps: Address audit findings promptly and implement recommendations from the audit report.
   
   - Mitigation Actions Taken:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Recommendations from the last audit need to be acted upon.
     - Mitigation Steps: Assign responsibility for implementing audit recommendations to specific team members.
