     - Root Cause: Lack of robust transaction validation processes.
     - Mitigation Steps: Implement automated checks for duplicate entries and enhance transaction logging mechanisms.

   - Outlier Detection:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Inconsistent transaction patterns.
     - Mitigation Steps: Utilize data analytics tools to flag outliers for manual review and establish thresholds for normal transaction behavior.

   - Invoice Mismatches:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Discrepancies between purchase orders and invoices.
     - Mitigation Steps: Enforce stricter PO-invoice matching validation and provide training for staff on compliance procedures.

2. Compliance:
   - Policy Violations:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Unapproved vendor invoicing and unjustified hardware purchases.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct regular compliance training and audits to ensure adherence to policies.

   - Manual Overrides:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Frequent manual interventions in the transaction process.
     - Mitigation Steps: Review and streamline approval workflows to minimize the need for manual overrides.

   - Approval Process Bypasses:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Inadequate control over the approval process.
     - Mitigation Steps: Implement a more rigorous approval process with defined roles and responsibilities.

3. Fraud Risk:
   - Multiple Payments to Same Vendor/Account:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Lack of monitoring for payment patterns.
     - Mitigation Steps: Flag and freeze suspicious accounts and conduct periodic reviews of vendor payment histories.

   - Unusual Fund Flows:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Unexplained fund flows amounting to $47,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Investigate unexplained transactions and enhance monitoring of cash flow activities.

   - Unjustified Transactions:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Lack of documentation for certain purchases.
     - Mitigation Steps: Require detailed justification and documentation for all transactions above a certain threshold.

4. Vendor Risk:
   - Vendor Performance Issues:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Late deliverables and invoice discrepancies.
     - Mitigation Steps: Conduct vendor risk re-evaluation and establish performance metrics for vendor evaluations.

   - Compliance Flags:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: High-risk vendors identified.
     - Mitigation Steps: Increase scrutiny of high-risk vendors and enhance onboarding processes to ensure compliance.

   - High Dependency Vendors:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Reliance on a limited number of vendors.
     - Mitigation Steps: Diversify the vendor base and develop relationships with alternative suppliers.

5. Financial Exposure:
   - Budget Variance:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Estimated final spend exceeding the budget by $150,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Monitor budget closely and implement cost-control measures to avoid overruns.

   - Overdue Payments:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: 3 overdue payables amounting to $120,000.
     - Mitigation Steps: Accelerate payment approval workflows and establish reminders for payment deadlines.

   - Credit Exposure:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: 73.3% of credit limit utilized.
     - Mitigation Steps: Review credit utilization and negotiate for higher limits or alternative financing options.

   - Spend over Authorization:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Unapproved expenditures.
     - Mitigation Steps: Strengthen authorization processes and conduct regular audits of spending.

6. Operational Risk:
   - Timeline Impact:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Schedule variance of 8 days.
     - Mitigation Steps: Regularly review project timelines and adjust resources as necessary to stay on track.

   - Resource Risk:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Resource turnover at 12.5%.
     - Mitigation Steps: Develop retention strategies and invest in employee training to maintain expertise.

   - High Cloud Spend:
     - Severity: High
     - Root Cause: Monthly cloud spend exceeding thresholds.
     - Mitigation Steps: Optimize cloud resource usage and explore cost-effective cloud service options.

7. Audit & Traceability:
   - Audit Trail Completeness:
     - Severity: Medium
     - Root Cause: Incomplete documentation for transactions.
     - Mitigation Steps: Ensure all transactions are logged and maintain comprehensive records for audit purposes.

   - Last Audit Findings:
