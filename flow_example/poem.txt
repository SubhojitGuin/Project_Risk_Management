In the garden where heartbeats bloom,  
Love weaves its threads, dispelling the gloom.  
It dances in whispers, sweet and low,  
A gentle touch in the ebb and flow.  

With eyes that spark like starlit skies,  
It finds the truth where shadows lie.  
Two souls entwined, a sacred blend,  
A promise spoken, a vow to transcend.  

Through storms it stands, unwavering and bold,  
The essence of love, a story retold.
